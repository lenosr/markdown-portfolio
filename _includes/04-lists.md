I am a motivated learner, goal-oriented professional providing high quality solutions to clients from private and public sector for ten years.

I have developed projects across different industries (investment management, aerospace research, fintech).

I work at the intersection of statistics, math, computing, data science, finance and engineering.

I am currently interested in: 

1 - KDE - Kernel Density Estimation and I am working on it, particularly on:
   1. Visualizations 
   
   ![Joint Distribution KDE](https://github.com/lenosr/markdown-portfolio/raw/master/_includes/GifJointDist.gif)

   ![Cond Distribution](https://github.com/lenosr/KDE-Kernel-density-estimation/raw/master/FinalGIf.gif)

   2. Application of Levy process
   3. Application of Truncated Levy flight
   4. Evaluation with general and financial data.

2 - Coding in Python following the [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/#id2) PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal). But [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is also a great guide.

Many times, I see things that other people do not see. In my career, I have seen meaning
where others have seen no meaning.
